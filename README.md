## OutSmart
#### by Fiona Young



### Overview
OutSmart, this interactive game, is set in a utopian/dystopian world where players are able to run through different scenarios that send them into the different fates within each community. There are six different endings and one loop ending that sends players through a timeline of either selfish self-destruction, power-hungry takeovers, or simple tranquility. The possibilities are theirs to take. This project explores the growing utilization and dependence of Smart devices in homes today, and expresses the fears and possibilities of a full-fledged country of fully developed Smart Homes.
